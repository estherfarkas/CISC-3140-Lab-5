# CISC-3140-Lab-5
For this assignment, I used SCP command to take a CSV File from Spotify Charts, and parse it into my remote terminal.
Once that was done, I used a while loop and IFS=',' to extract the artist names column and printed it to the terminal, and a text file
Then I used the sort command on the text file to give an alphabetical list of artist names. 
For task 2, I repeated the steps I did in task 1, but this time i did it within a shell script, so that it could be called by one command.
For the 3rd task, I used curl command to download images from the internet. 
I checked if image magick was available on terminal and it was, so I atempted to use the composite command to mix the two images together.
Unfortunately, I dont think I was able to get the magick command to work this time. 
It took me several log sessions but I managed to get the tasks eventually.
