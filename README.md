# CISC-3140-Lab-5
*What to submit:* 

- Please submit a record of terminal activities.
- Advice: You should describe *what you were trying to do* along with *what you did.*
    - For example, could be a readme file that describes what your file contents contains with files that show what you did.
    - Or it could be comments (if it makes sense to you on how to do this with shell files you can otherwise disregard this comment)

*How to package:*

- Publish your log files to a remote repository (GitHub/Github/whatever) so that I can access it
    - This is typically a log file, as in session.log.
    - Pick filenames that make sense to you.
    - Avoid submitting RTF or word document files for this work.
    - I can infer a lot from seeing the order of commands you've inputted into the terminal, so don't worry about logs being brief.
- How you store files is up to you, as long as I can easily find the relevant files for this assignment.
    - You can save in 1,2,3,10,n files. Whatever breakdown makes sense to you.
- Should you include the resulting output from task 3?
    - It depends on what you're trying to convey to your reader. Are you trying to show that your "program" works?
